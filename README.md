Rule:
Opposing 2 people against each other, whoever HOLD their points to 100 points will be the winner.
Each time you roll the dice, you will add to the pocket.. Turn to your opponent if the dice roll 1 and then randomly the next time you roll the dice, it will be added to the pocket or jump to someone else (depending on how greedy you are haha)

# WIN - WIN
